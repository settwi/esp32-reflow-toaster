# ESP32 reflow toaster oven temperature controller
- To be used with relays + MAX6675 temperature IC (SPI)
- Build and flash with Espressif `idf.py`, following [install instructions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html)
- Communicate with the ESP32 using a serial port.
The .ipynb shows an example of plotting the temperature over time, assuming `port = /dev/ttyUSB1`.
